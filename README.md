# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
This repository contains the code for building movie recommendation engine.

The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. This project is designed to help you understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works.

It turns out that there are (mostly) three ways to build a recommendation engine:

Popularity based recommendation engine
Content based recommendation engine
Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine
