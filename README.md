# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
This repository contains the code for building movie recommendation engine.

The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. This project is designed to help you understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works.

It turns out that there are (mostly) three ways to build a recommendation engine:

   1. Popularity based recommendation engine
   2. Content based recommendation engine
   3. Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine
